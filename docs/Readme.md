## About
The AR Christmas Experience allows users to access an immersive festive environment through a simple QR-based flow.
By scanning a QR code, users reach a clean and UX-friendly landing page containing a download button for the Android APK.
Once installed, the user scans the same QR code **inside the app** to begin the AR experience — featuring falling snow, an interactive snowman, and a Christmas carol performance surrounding the user.
